The project advances by rebasing a complete PostgreSQL-derived server, so a version number conveys two moving surfaces: upstream PostgreSQL behavior and AgensGraph graph patches. Upgrade and extension qualification must cover both. A stock PostgreSQL extension compatibility statement is not automatically transitive to a fork compiled at a different server ABI.

## Lineage and evidence findings

### F001 — Product form

- Finding: AgensGraph 2.17 is a PostgreSQL 17.10 source fork and complete server distribution, not a loadable extension for arbitrary stock PostgreSQL.
- Evidence class: S01,S04
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F002 — Stable release

- Finding: v2.17.0 is the newest stable GitHub release found at the research cut and was published on 2026-06-19.
- Evidence class: S01,S06
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F003 — Development head

- Finding: Public main identified itself as 2.18-devel at the pinned August 4 commit and differs materially from stable.
- Evidence class: S05
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F004 — Graph representation

- Finding: A graph is represented by a PostgreSQL schema plus AgensGraph catalogs; every label is a relation inheriting from the graph's base vertex or edge relation.
- Evidence class: S21-S25,S32
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F005 — Vertex tuple

- Finding: A stable vertex tuple stores graphid and non-null JSONB properties; a vertex-label primary key indexes id.

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F006 — Edge tuple

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F007 — Graph value row identity

- Finding: The vertex/edge composite types also carry a `tid` populated from the heap `ctid`; it is execution identity metadata, not an additional user-declared label-table column.

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F008 — Endpoint indexes

- Finding: Every edge label receives B-tree indexes on `(start,end)` and `(end,start)`, plus a BRIN index on edge id.

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F009 — Identifier layout

- Evidence class: S23
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F010 — Label ceiling

- Finding: The encoding provides at most 65,535 label identifiers and 2^48 local identifiers per label; these are encoding ceilings, not validated capacity claims.
- Evidence class: S23
- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F011 — Properties

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

- Decision use: retain this statement only with its version and evidence qualifier.
- Revalidation: repeat after a release, storage-layout change, or benchmark-baseline change.

### F015 — ACID base
