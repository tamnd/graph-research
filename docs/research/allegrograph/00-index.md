# AllegroGraph 9.0.2 deep audit: index and decision verdict

Research cut: `2026-08-08`
Product baseline: `AllegroGraph 9.0.2`
Evidence status: current manual audited; public client/container source pinned; proprietary server internals unavailable
Scope: Navigation, executive verdict, evidence boundaries, target-fit score and acceptance gates

## Audit outcome

AllegroGraph is a mature, feature-dense RDF database with a documented disk-index design, two query engines, reasoning, ACID snapshot transactions, active-active MMR and FedShard horizontal partitioning. It deserves serious comparison for knowledge-graph workloads, especially when SPARQL, Prolog and rule systems matter.

It does not satisfy the target architecture as shipped. S3 is an import/archive destination rather than the online authority; seven default index permutations create material amplification; FedShard broadcasts work and depends on partition-key locality; shard splitting is offline; MMR and FedShard are separate layers with explicit consistency and controller caveats; commercial cost is not public. The historical trillion-triple load remains noteworthy but cannot establish current low latency, PB online scale, fixed S3 cost or a universal 10x win.

The decisive reuse is conceptual: compact term dictionaries, permutation choices driven by workload, explicit query-engine selection, RDF reasoning and partition-aware execution. The proposed system should replace mutable local-only authority with immutable S3 segments, use a thin metadata/lease plane, bound every traversal, separate serving replicas from durable data and publish reproducible correctness-first benchmarks.

| Dimension | Audited status | Target implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low latency | Plausible with warm mapped indices; workload-specific and unmeasured here | Test cold, warm, checkpoint and saturation tails |
| Low resource | Default index and memory guidance are substantial | Minimize permutations and make caches disposable |
| Distributed | FedShard partitions; MMR replicates | Keep placement, durability and capacity contracts separate |
| Fixed S3 cost | S3 is archive/import, not live authority | Use immutable object segments plus hard budgets |
| PB / extreme edges | Historical trillion load; no PB or thousand-trillion proof | Require measured staged qualification |
| 10x | No current audited universal result | Use correctness-first family-specific ratios |
