# AllegroGraph storage, indices, IDs, and RDF data-model audit

Research cut: `2026-08-08`
Product baseline: `AllegroGraph 9.0.2`
Evidence status: current manual audited; public client/container source pinned; proprietary server internals unavailable
Scope: Physical documented model, dictionary encoding, index permutations, amplification, attributes, optimization and capacity

## Audit outcome

AllegroGraph stores RDF statements and repository-local IDs behind disk-resident sorted index permutations. The default seven-index set favors many access patterns, but the vendor's own rule of thumb—about 100 bytes per triple—makes amplification a first-order design constraint. One trillion triples at that heuristic is about 100 TB before replicas, backups, free space, logs, temporary data and operational headroom; it is not evidence of a petabyte logical graph.

The string table deduplicates IRIs and lexical strings. Index optimization and deletion handling mean physical health changes with workload history, so every benchmark needs both freshly built and churned stores, index Oscore, deleted-triple state and exact index set. Triple attributes add security/provenance metadata but are immutable after creation and are not indexed, limiting selective retrieval.

| Dimension | Audited status | Target implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low latency | Plausible with warm mapped indices; workload-specific and unmeasured here | Test cold, warm, checkpoint and saturation tails |
| Low resource | Default index and memory guidance are substantial | Minimize permutations and make caches disposable |
| Distributed | FedShard partitions; MMR replicates | Keep placement, durability and capacity contracts separate |
| Fixed S3 cost | S3 is archive/import, not live authority | Use immutable object segments plus hard budgets |
| PB / extreme edges | Historical trillion load; no PB or thousand-trillion proof | Require measured staged qualification |
| 10x | No current audited universal result | Use correctness-first family-specific ratios |
